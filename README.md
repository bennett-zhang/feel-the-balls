# feel-the-balls

An Android app that uses the device's gyroscope and vibration motors to
simulate a box full of balls.

While tilting the box, the user can feel and hear the balls jostling
around inside. Through auditory and tactile cues alone, the user is prompted
to guess how many balls there are.
